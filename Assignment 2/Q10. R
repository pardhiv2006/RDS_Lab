## 10. Create and store a three-dimensional array with six layers of a 4 x 2 matrix, filled with a 
       decreasing sequence of values between 4.8 and 0.1 of the appropriate length. 

values <- seq(from = 4.8, to = 0.1, length.out = 48)

array_3D <- array(values, dim = c(4, 2, 6))

print(array_3D)
