## 24. Construct a three-dimensional array with four layers, each a 3 x 3 matrix filled with random 
       numbers between 1 and 9. Then, extract the elements of the first row of the third column across all 
       layers and store them as a new vector.

array_3d <- array(sample(1:9, 4 * 3 * 3, replace = TRUE), dim = c(3, 3, 4))

print(array_3d)

new_vec <- array_3d[1, 3, ]

print(new_vec)
